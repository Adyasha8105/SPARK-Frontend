#### A Virtual Waiting Queue App for Medicals.

Spark Healthlines is a modern-day designed, enhanced user experience, multi-functional, mobile ready app developed to give in-person patients the freedom to wait for their turn privately in their car—or wherever they choose—rather than confining them to a stuffy, crowded waiting room alongside new germs and potential infections and facilitating a smooth check-in process for healthcare visits.

> Traditional waiting rooms that require patients to touch shared surfaces
> and breathe shared air are beyond uncomfortable—they can be unsafe.
> Virtual waiting rooms enable social distancing to
> support a better patient experience and better outcomes.
> A virtual waiting room helps you
> prevent your healthcare organization from being associated with pesky sounds, smells, people,
> and boredom that can easily be avoided.
