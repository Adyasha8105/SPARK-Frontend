## About The Project

#### A Virtual Waiting Queue App for Medical use ü©∫

[Spark Healthlines](https://spark-healthlines.vercel.app/) is a modern-day designed, enhanced user experience, multi-functional, mobile ready app developed to give in-person patients the freedom to wait for their turn privately in their car‚Äîor wherever they choose‚Äîrather than confining them to a stuffy, crowded waiting room alongside new germs and potential infections and facilitating a smooth check-in process for healthcare visits üßëüèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

> Traditional waiting rooms that require patients to touch shared surfaces
> and breathe shared air are beyond uncomfortable‚Äîthey can be unsafe.
> It is not only incovinient for the patients to stand in long queues but also the crowd prove to be a breeding ground for germs and potential infections.

#### Our Solution

Virtual waiting rooms enable social distancing to support a better patient experience and better outcomes.
A virtual waiting room helps you prevent your healthcare organization from being associated with pesky sounds, smells, people, and boredom that can easily be avoided.
